# sharepoint_remote_client

## Description

I made this program during my first year of uni. Also this is my first ever "bigger" project.
I got an opportunity from a state-owned company to work on this project on my own. The goal was to make work faster, because they found the online editor a bit too slow.
Unfortunately the company decided to replace Sharepoint with some other technology, so my program became useless for them.
This is the last version I've touched and it hasn't been modified since then.
Maybe I'll finish it one day...

The code is not the prettiest and it needs a lot of refactoring, but it shows some progression.
It uses the **Sharepoint client object model (CSOM)**.
It is specifically written to manage lists.


## Functions
- Logging into sites
- Changing between sites on the go
- Reading data from a list
- Adding new data to a list
- Updating existing data in a list
- Deleting data from a list
- Filtering data in a list

**NOTE: It's not specifically written for the company's site. It works on any Sharepoint website.**
